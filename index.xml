A well-trained shooter who practices that element into their draw can get it done in under 1 and 1/2 seconds total. The delay added by racking the slide is probably 1/2 second.</description>

Pistol grips, hand guards, stocks, optics, if you wanted to invest in making that M4 something crazy, then you could go for it.

Roughly 3,000 silkworms are killed to make a single pound of silk. That means that billions, if not trillions, of them are killed for this every year.22 Aug 2018

Does All Seaweed Taste Like Fish? [Solved] Is Seaweed Fishy? The simplest answer would be, no seaweed does not necessarily taste or smell like fish.

      <description>Hola, iam Meredith Kaufman, Have an awesome day!
Can I Connect Neutral And Ground Together? [Solved] No, the neutral and ground should never be wired together. This is wrong, and potentially dangerous. When you plug in something in the outlet, the neutral will be live, as it closes the circuit. If the ground is wired to the neutral, the ground of the applicance will also be live.

According to the findings, alcohol does allow healthy people to fall asleep quicker and sleep more deeply for a while, but it reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. And the more you drink before bed, the more pronounced these effects.22 Jan 2013</description>

IMO you need at least the most recent expansion + the current season pass to get the most out of the game though. You get access to patrol zones, strikes, nightfalls, crucible, gambit, a dungeon, and a raid for free.</description>

      <description>Hola, iam John Baxter, Don’t worry, it’s one day closer to the weekend.
Can You Backstab Radagon? [Solved] Radagon can&amp;rsquo;t be backstabbed, but he is vulnerable to being staggered and having his poise broken, and his more standard melee strikes can even be parried, for the particularly confident player. Combined with his long cooldowns after certain attacks, these are your chances to hit him with jump/heavy attacks.7 Apr 2022

Can You Win Civ 6 Without War? [Solved] Civ 6&amp;rsquo;s design strongly encourages use of military units as a means to victory. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to win the game through a technological space race, or cultural / religious dominance. But these victory conditions are almost always predicated on a strong military, and perhaps an aggressively imperialist foreign policy.1 Nov 2016

To force the obstacles to spawn at the border all you have to do is a base without any 2x2 empty space. The obstacles require a 2x2 space to spawn.4 Dec 2018</description>

      <description>Hello, iam Francis Young, G’day, mate.

Do Mules Have Sperm? [Solved] Having an extra chromosome can cause all sorts of problems in other species, but this abnormality doesn&amp;rsquo;t hinder the mule much except when it comes to reproduction. Most mules do not produce viable eggs or sperm, and are therefore rendered infertile.

Do You Give A Gift At A Going Away Party? [Solved] Going-away gifts aren&amp;rsquo;t mandatory by any means, but everyone appreciates getting something thoughtful that shows just how much they&amp;rsquo;ll be missed.

      <description>Howdy, iam Diane Rodriguez, Don’t worry, it’s one day closer to the weekend.
Do You Say I&amp;rsquo;Ll Bet Or I Bet? [Solved] You can find examples in standard dictionaries for both “I bet” and “I&amp;rsquo;ll bet” used in this sense, though “I bet” is more common. In our opinion, “I bet” (present tense) sounds more natural when the subordinate construction is in the past tense (“I bet she felt crummy”) or the future tense (“I bet he&amp;rsquo;ll forget”).</description>

Can I Have A Baby At 42? [Solved] With age, you&amp;rsquo;re also at a higher risk for disorders that affect your fertility. If you get pregnant at 40 to 45 years old, experts consider this a “late” pregnancy. But it&amp;rsquo;s still possible to get pregnant and deliver a healthy baby in your 40s. Childbirth at older ages has become more common too.</description>

      <description>Namaste, iam Jennifer Montgomery, Don’t miss me too much.
Can You Transfer Items In Dark Souls 3? [Solved] There&amp;rsquo;s no feature to do that in the game. However, you can drop the items for a friend, switch characters, and your friend can give them back to you. It can be done, but requires two people to do. Some items can&amp;rsquo;t be seen by other players on the ground, either.6 May 2016</description>

      <description>Hi, iam Sandra Mercado, I hope today is better than yesterday.
Do Italians Drizzle Olive Oil On Pasta? [Solved] And it&amp;rsquo;s just downright wrong — at least, according to Italians. The truth is that olive oil and pasta are a match made in heaven, but only once the pasta is cooked. Adding the oil to the boiling water before you pour in the pasta or drizzling it on top as the pasta is boiling away does not do it any favors.</description>

Markedly, most heavy drinkers experience puffy and red faces.9 May 2022

      <description>Hello, iam Ashley Arch, May your day be joyful.
Are Fanboys Rude? [Solved] “Fanboy,” as an insult, is often an unfair and out-of-context accusation. More often than not, it is used in arguments between two or more people as a way to disregard a person&amp;rsquo;s point of view. To many, casting someone off as a fanboy is far easier than attempting to understand an opposing viewpoint.22 Aug 2013

Can You Put Regular Butter In A Popcorn Machine? [Solved] If you are using a popcorn machine, you should not use butter. The problem is that if you put a chunk of butter in the machine, it can sink to the floor and burn. Butter has a lower smoke point than oil does, so it will burn and create smoke more quickly. This can burn the popcorn.</description>

Does A +1 Weapon Do Magic Damage? [Solved] There is no such thing as &amp;ldquo;magical damage&amp;rdquo;. The list of damage types includes &amp;ldquo;radiant&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;necrotic&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bludgeoning&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;fire&amp;rdquo;, and so on. The +1 Mace does Bludgeoning damage, but it is a magic item and therefore does so as a magical attack. Hence it bypasses the resistance to &amp;ldquo;bludgeoning damage from non-magical attacks&amp;rdquo;.30 Jun 2016</description>

Do You Have To Sand Before Whitewashing? [Solved] Whitewashing works best on raw wood. That being the case, it&amp;rsquo;s critical that you remove as much of any existing finish—be it paint, stain, or varnish—as possible. Do so by thoroughly sanding the surface you intend to whitewash. Sanding by hand is one option, but it&amp;rsquo;s far quicker and easier to opt for a power sander.</description>

Once you do use them and they&amp;rsquo;re successfully summoned, you cannot re-summon them until you rest at a site of grace (bonfire). So you can&amp;rsquo;t spam NPC ally summons, even if you have the FP (MP) to do it.</description>

The chemical compounds that give carrots their vivid colour, carotenoids, are usually used by plants that grow above ground to assist in the process of photosynthesis.26 Sept 2018

      <description>Hola, iam Lilian Stone, Peace out!
Does A +1 Weapon Add To Damage? [Solved] No &amp;amp; Yes. A +1 weapon overcomes Resistance which requires a magic weapon which is rare in PF2 even though common in DnD/PF1. It&amp;rsquo;s still doing physical damage and gets resisted by Resistance Physical unless it says &amp;ldquo;Except magical&amp;rdquo; or something similar. A scimitar only does Slashing damage, so yep.12 Feb 2022

The hungry creatures chew through the outer bark of the tree to get to this green cambium. Rodent tree damage can be moderate, but it can also be very serious.9 Dec 2021</description>

      <description>Howdy, iam Glenda Roye, May your day be joyful.
Can Horses Mate With Zebras? [Solved] Horses and zebras can reproduce, and whether the result is a zorse or a hebra depends on the parents. It&amp;rsquo;s an unusual pairing usually requiring human help. Other zebra hybrids include the zonkey. Properly imprinted, equine hybrids can be trained like other domestic donkeys and horses.

Like others have said, a properly adjusted backpack makes a big difference. Make sure the weight is distributed evenly, with more of the weight biased towards the bottom of the pack.</description>

Can Japanese Say L? [Solved] There is no L sound in Japanese, so they opt for the nearest sound they can manage, which is the Japanese R, a sound that English natives find it hard to master, and nothing like L at all in how it is articulated. The Japanese R approximates the English one but with a click, a tongue tap against the hard palate.</description>

Do Side Missions Scale In Borderlands 2? [Solved] No. In UVHM the quest reward scales to the level you accept the quest at. So if you accept it at level 61, and level to 80 before turning it in, the reward will be at 61. The quest however will always scale to you so make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t accept sidequests with items you want until you&amp;rsquo;re level 80.</description>

Can I Use Melted Butter Instead Of Oil In Popcorn Machine? [Solved] While you can use butter instead of oil in a popcorn machine, it is not recommended.

      <description>Howdy, iam Ann Williams, Don’t miss me too much.
Can I Play Mtg With Old Cards? [Solved] Cheers! You can play them in Casual (not a &amp;ldquo;sanctioned&amp;rdquo; format, aka no events for it), Legacy, Vintage (I think?), and in EDH (also not a &amp;ldquo;sanctioned&amp;rdquo; format, but stores hold events for it, but no DCI rating). Not Standard or Modern, but those formats are pretty expensive.2 Sept 2011

Can You Be A Godparent Without Being Baptised? [Solved] While the secular interpretation of godparent is a bit of a free-for-all, the Christian interpretation is not. To be a godparent to a Catholic child, you have to be a baptised, practising Catholic (although a baptised person from another denomination can serve as an “official witness”).12 Oct 2019

From here, we would also recommend that you bait him for a backstab if he tried to grab you with his right hand.</description>

Are Shields Useful In Dead Cells? [Solved] Carrying a shield creates a force field for half a second when the player takes damage.

Two acres, if managed properly, should provide adequate forage in the form of pasture and/or hay ground. But this is highly variable depending on location.</description>

      <description>Greetings, iam Frank Cohen, Hope you&amp;rsquo;re doing good!

If you interlock, you can go as long as eight weeks between retwists.</description>
